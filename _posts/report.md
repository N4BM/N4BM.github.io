# WannaCry Ransomware: Full Technical Analysis Lab Report

*By [Your Name]*

WannaCry (WanaCrypt0r 2.0) shook the world in May 2017, leveraging the leaked EternalBlue exploit for rapid wormable spread. This post details my complete hands-on analysis of a WannaCry sample, with **every lab step and screenshot included**.

## 1. Sample Acquisition and Verification

The analysis began by acquiring a known WannaCry sample and verifying its hash.

**Sample hash and VirusTotal report:**

## 2. Initial Static Analysis

Using various static tools, we confirmed the sample as a Windows PE32 executable.

**Detect It Easy, basic PE scan:**

![Entropy check](wannacry_screenshots/3.jpg)  
![Optional headers](wannacry_screenshots/4.jpg)  
![File info](wannacry_screenshots/5.jpg)

**Timestamp Analysis:**  
The compile time field indicates a 2017 date, consistent with the outbreak.

## 3. PE File Structure

### Section Analysis

A detailed review of PE sections was performed using Resource Hacker and similar tools.

- `.text`, `.rdata`, `.data` (standard)
- Suspicious extra or padded sections observed.

**Screenshots:**

## 4. Strings and Resource Analysis

Strings analysis exposed key artifacts:

- Ransom message content
- Bitcoin addresses
- Kill switch domain
- List of encrypted file extensions

**Strings tool output:**

## 5. Dynamic Analysis

### Lab Setup

Sample executed inside a controlled Windows VM. Monitored with Process Explorer, Regshot, etc.

#### **Process Explorer / Running Processes**
- WannaCry injects into legitimate processes, spawns new instances.

![Processes tree](wannacry_screenshots/15.jpg)  
![Child process](wannacry_screenshots/16.jpg)

#### **File Operations**

- Ransom notes dropped in multiple directories.
- Wallpaper changed by malware.

![File explorer - affected](wannacry_screenshots/22.jpg)  
![Hidden files revealed](wannacry_screenshots/23.jpg)  
![Shadow copies deleted](wannacry_screenshots/24.jpg)

#### **Regshot / Registry Analysis**
- Persistence via registry Run keys and service creation.

## 6. Network Activity and Kill Switch

- WannaCry attempts to contact the kill switch domain at startup.
- SMB scanning observed.
- DNS requests and network activity logged.

**Network/URL screenshots:**

## 7. Ransom Note & File Impact

- `@Please_Read_Me@.txt` dropped in all user directories.
- Custom desktop background set.

**Screenshots:**

## 8. Persistence & Registry Changes

- Adds itself to Startup via registry keys.
- Installs as a service.

**Screenshots:**

## 9. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)

**File hashes:**  
- See VirusTotal screenshot (`varida.jpg`)

**Bitcoin wallets, kill switch domain, ransom note paths:**  
- Extracted from `strings.jpg` and resource screenshots.

**Network:**  
- Outbound attempts to `iuqerfsodp9ifjaposdfjhgosurijfaewrwergwea.com`
- Unusual SMB traffic (port 445)

**Registry:**  
- Persistence Run keys and custom service names.

## 10. Conclusions & Lessons Learned

WannaCry combined a wormable exploit with ransomware, creating a global incident. Key takeaways:

- Patch critical vulnerabilities immediately (EternalBlue/MS17-010 was patched before the outbreak!)
- Isolate and monitor network segments to limit wormable malware.
- Keep offline, secure backups to prevent ransomware impact.
