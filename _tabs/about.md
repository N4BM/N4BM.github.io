Hi, I'm Naif Alanazi — a cybersecurity graduate from RIT with a strong interest in offensive security, threat detection, and digital forensics. I created this blog to share my journey, document hands-on projects, and explore the techniques used by both attackers and defenders.

During my time at RIT, I worked on advanced labs and real-world projects in areas like malware analysis, red teaming, and machine learning for threat detection. Now that I’ve graduated, I’m focused on expanding my research, contributing to the community.

This blog is my way of giving back and staying sharp. Thanks for stopping by.
